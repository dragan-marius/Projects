# MarsGrid Energy Network Simulator

**Source Code Availability**
    The actual source code for this project is maintained in a private
repository. However, I am more than happy to grant repository access upon
request or present the codebase via screen share during an interview.

## Overview

MarsGrid is a simulation system designed to manage the energy network of
an autonomous colony on Mars. The application models energy producers,
consumers and storage units, and simulates how energy is balanced
across the network during discrete time steps (ticks).

The system is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming principles,
including abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism.

## Architecture

## Base Class

* NetworkComponent - Common attributes: 'id', 'statusOperational' -
Parent class for all grid components

## Energy Producers

* EnergyProducer - Defines 'calculateProduction()' and
'displayDetails()'

* SolarPanel : production depends on sunlight factor
* WindTurbine : production depends on wind factor
* NuclearReactor : constant production if operational

Energy Consumers

* EnergyConsumer(Abstract) : Contains attributes like 'energyDemand', 'priority'
and 'isPowered', along with methods such as 'getCurrentDemand()' and 'disconnectFromGrid()'.
* LifeSupportSystem (priority 1) - Critical consumer
* ScientificLaboratory (priority 2) - High-importance consumer
* LightingSystem (priority 3) - Standard consumer

## Energy Storage
* Battery- Contains atributes 'maximumCapacity' and 'storedEnergy'. Implements methods to 'charge()'(stores energy without exceeding capacity) 'discharge()'( provides energy if available) 'displayDetails()'

## Simulation Logic

The system operates in simulation ticks.

Each tick performs the following steps:

1.  Reset all consumers as powered.
2.  Calculate total production.
3.  Calculate total demand.
4.  If surplus exists → charge batteries.
5.  If deficit exists → discharge batteries.
6.  If deficit remains → disconnect consumers by priority (3, then 2).
7.  If deficit still remains → BLACKOUT.
8.  Stop future simulation when blackout occurs.
9.  Store simulation events in history.

## Command System

The application is interactive and processes commands from the console.

Main Commands

-   Add producer
-   Add consumer
-   Add battery
-   Simulate next tick
-   Set component operational status
-   Display grid status
-   Display event history
-   Exit simulator

All inputs are validated, including unique IDs and positive numeric
values.

## Technologies Used

-   Java
-   Object-Oriented Programming
-   ArrayLists for component management
-   Command-line interface

## How to Run

javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")
java -cp out main.java.grid.controller.Main

## Example Simulation Behavior

-   Energy production and consumption are balanced dynamically.
-   Batteries store surplus energy and supply deficit energy.
-   Lower-priority consumers are disconnected if needed.
-   System enters BLACKOUT if critical demand cannot be sustained.

## Event History

The system records major events such as: - consumer disconnections -
deficits - blackout events
